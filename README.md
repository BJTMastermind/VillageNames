This is a mod for Minecraft Forge that allows the user to generate random names for Villagers and villages.

Right-clicking blank books on villagers records the village's information, and if the villager has many unlocked trades and/or your village reputation is high, villagers may record a hint about directions to a feature such as e.g. a Stronghold or Temple.

Right-clicking emeralds and/or iron/gold ingots onto a Librarian causes them to generate a Codex, with which you can record names for unpopulated structures (e.g. Temples, Mineshafts).

Mod versions earlier than 1.12 have backported Concrete, Concrete Powder, and Glazed Terracotta.

Version 1.7.10 has backported Prismarine, absorbent Sponges, and Ocean Monuments.

You can similarly name Galacticraft / More Planets / Witchery villagers and entities.
