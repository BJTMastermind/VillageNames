When a village first generates, it creates a list of structures to be included.
There can be multiple copies of a structure in the list, and typically only
some of the list will be constructed until the village reaches a certain size.
The rest of the list is ignored.

Generation of the modern village structure components is handled in the configs
by five comma-separated values of the form:

a,b,c,d,e

a is the structure generation weight. The higher this value, the more likely
the structure will be selected from the list. Set it to 0 to prevent this
structure component from spawning.

The number of copies of a structure that can be in a list is a random integer
between

b*s + c
and
d*s + e

where s is the Village Size config value you specified. Thus, there will never
be more than d×s + e copies of a given structure in a village. There is no
guarantee to be at least b×s + c copies, however.

There is no strict requirement that b, c, d, e must be non-negative, but be
careful to ensure that (b*s + c) is not greater than (d*s + e), and that neither
total is less than zero.

Every village will always have exactly one town center, selected based on biome.
